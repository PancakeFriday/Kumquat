Run the game
---
To run the game, execute `./run_all`. This is gonna open a terminal for the server, some more terminals and three windows for the clients. Then you can join a public match and as soon as everyone is ready (when they are initially ready, you might have to hit the button twice), the game starts. Only one player controls the square, the others will watch.
If you don't have xfce4-terminal installed, you need to change that in the run_all script.
